# PolicyByte

**Bite-sized summaries of legislation across America.**

PolicyByte transforms complex state legislation into clear, accessible summaries using AI. Navigate an interactive map of the United States to discover current bills, policy changes, and their potential impact on citizens, businesses, and communities.

## What It Does

- **Interactive Map**: Click any state to explore current legislation
- **AI Summaries**: Complex bills broken down into 2-3 sentence summaries
- **Smart Categorization**: Bills automatically tagged by topic (Education, Healthcare, Environment, etc.)
- **Real-time Updates**: Fresh legislative data scraped from state websites
- **Impact Analysis**: Understand who bills affect and how

## Why PolicyByte?

Staying informed about state legislation is crucial but challenging. Bills are often hundreds of pages long, written in legal language, and scattered across different state websites. PolicyByte solves this by:

- Automatically finding and tracking new bills
- Using AI to create plain-English summaries
- Organizing everything in one searchable, visual interface
- Highlighting the practical impact on everyday life

## How It Works

1. **Scraping**: Automated collection of bills from state legislative websites
2. **AI Analysis**: OpenAI processes full bill text to generate summaries and categorizations
3. **Visualization**: Interactive map displays current legislative activity by state
4. **Updates**: Regular monitoring ensures fresh, relevant content

## Currently Supported States

California, Texas, New York, Florida (with more states being added regularly)

## Tech Stack

Built with modern web technologies for reliability and performance:

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js API routes, PostgreSQL database
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4 for intelligent summarization
